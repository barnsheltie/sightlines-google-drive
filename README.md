AI generated code for google drive digital twin

### Prompt
~~~
Got it! So, the digital twin will be an array of user meta-data, where each element represents a user's Google Drive metadata. The metadata for each user will include:
User Meta-data:
Total Number of Files: The total number of files in the user's Google Drive.
Total Number of Folders: The total number of folders in the user's Google Drive.
Folder Meta-data: An array of folder meta-data, where each element represents a folder and contains:
Folder URL: The URL of the folder.
Folder Contents: An array of items (files and subfolders) in the folder, with each item represented by its URL.
Item Access Permissions: An array of users who have access permissions for each item (file or folder), represented by their user IDs or emails.
This digital twin will provide a comprehensive representation of the users' Google Drive metadata, allowing for efficient synchronization and management of user data.

### What else?This is just a basic code structure to get you started. You still need to implement the logic for:
Synchronizing user metadata with Google Drive using the Google Drive API.
Updating the digital twin with the synchronized metadata.
Handling errors and exceptions.
Implementing the CRON scheduler to periodically synchronize the metadata.
Here's a high-level outline of the steps you need to take:
Authenticate with Google Drive using the service account credentials.
Use the Google Drive API to retrieve metadata for each user (files, folders, permissions).
Update the digital twin with the retrieved metadata.
Implement a scheduling mechanism (e.g., using node-schedule or cron) to periodically synchronize the metadata.
Handle errors and exceptions appropriately.
You'll also need to install the required packages, such as googleapis and google-auth-library, and import them in your code.
I can provide more guidance and code snippets to help you implement these steps if needed.
