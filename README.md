AI generated code for google drive digital twin

### Prompt



### What else?This is just a basic code structure to get you started. You still need to implement the logic for:
Synchronizing user metadata with Google Drive using the Google Drive API.
Updating the digital twin with the synchronized metadata.
Handling errors and exceptions.
Implementing the CRON scheduler to periodically synchronize the metadata.
Here's a high-level outline of the steps you need to take:
Authenticate with Google Drive using the service account credentials.
Use the Google Drive API to retrieve metadata for each user (files, folders, permissions).
Update the digital twin with the retrieved metadata.
Implement a scheduling mechanism (e.g., using node-schedule or cron) to periodically synchronize the metadata.
Handle errors and exceptions appropriately.
You'll also need to install the required packages, such as googleapis and google-auth-library, and import them in your code.
I can provide more guidance and code snippets to help you implement these steps if needed.
